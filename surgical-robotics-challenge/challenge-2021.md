# 2021 Raven/dVRK Surgical Robotics Challenge (online)

Automating surgical subtasks is an oft-mentioned research target for robot-assisted surgery. Certain subtasks, such as
suturing and resection, have been automated on test bench setups. Yet current works are often limited in scope
(i.e., based on very simplistic setups) and lack a standardized setup to reproduce results. In this challenge, we provide
a simulation platform for participants to develop algorithms to address various questions in surgical subtask
automation. The simulator contains two seven degrees-of-freedom (DOF) instrument arms based on the da Vinci Surgical
System large needle driver, a controllable camera based on the da Vinci Endoscopic Camera Manipulator (ECM), a suturing
phantom, and a needle with suture.
