# [ISMR 2019](http://www.ismr.gatech.edu/) Workshop on Open Platforms for Medical Robotics Research

**Workshop Date:**  April 3, 2019 (full day)

**Venue:** Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA USA

**Location:** 1128 Suddath Room, Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience (IBB)

## Objectives

The objectives of the first half of the workshop are to provide an overview and tutorial about: (1) two widely-used shared platforms for medical robotics research: the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) and Raven II, and (2) infrastructure that supports a broader community, such as the Collaborative Robotics Toolkit (CRTK), which provides a standard API to dVRK, Raven II and other systems, as well as simulation environments.

The objectives of the second half of the workshop are to provide an opportunity for members of the community to present research they have performed with these shared platforms, with the goal to promote sharing of infrastructure enhancements and collaborative research.  Thus, the presentations will consist of both talks (about 10 minutes) and posters. We will also hold a panel to discuss community needs, such as shared datasets.

## Call for Abstracts

We are soliciting extended abstracts, 1-2 pages in length, for possible presentation during the afternoon session. Abstracts should fit the theme of the workshop and focus on shared platforms and software or on research enabled by shared platforms and software. Please submit your abstract (PDF only) by email to [open-platforms-ismr-2019@googlegroups.com](mailto:open-platforms-ismr-2019@googlegroups.com).
**The deadline for abstract submission is February 8, 2019.**
Accepted abstracts will be posted on the workshop website, subject to author agreement.
