# [ISMR 2019](http://www.ismr.gatech.edu/) Workshop on Open Platforms for Medical Robotics Research

**Workshop Date:**  April 3, 2019 (full day)

**Venue:** Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA USA

**Location:** 1128 Suddath Room, Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience (IBB)

## Objectives

The objectives of the first half of the workshop are to provide an overview and tutorial about: (1) two widely-used shared platforms for medical robotics research: the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) and Raven II, and (2) infrastructure that supports a broader community, such as the Collaborative Robotics Toolkit (CRTK), which provides a standard API to dVRK, Raven II and other systems, as well as simulation environments. This is followed by a "hands on" session that will give attendees the opportunity to work with real and simulated robots and to teleoperate remote robots.

The objectives of the second half of the workshop are to provide an opportunity for members of the community to present research they have performed with these shared platforms, with the goal to promote sharing of infrastructure enhancements and collaborative research.  We will also hold a panel to discuss community needs, such as shared datasets.
