The _collaborative-robotics_ organization was created to develop a Common API for research in
teleoperated and collaborative robotics. We are developing an abstract definition of this API,
with concrete implementations in the _Collaborative Robotics Toolkit (CRTK)_.
The implementations focus on common shared research platforms, such as the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK)
and Raven II, and other devices commonly used by researchers. The provided implementation uses
[Robot Operating System (ROS)](www.ros.org), but could be extended to other middleware.
