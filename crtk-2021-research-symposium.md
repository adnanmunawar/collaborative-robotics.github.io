# Raven/dVRK Surgical Robotics Research Symposium

**Symposium Date:**  March 4, 2021

**Location:** Online via Zoom (details to follow shortly)

## Objectives

This is an online-only event for sharing within the common platform community.
The overall theme is experimental minimally-invasive surgical robotics research, typically, but not limited to,
work on the Raven and dVRK platforms. 


## Symposium Format

The symposium will be held across multiple days, with 1.5 hour online sessions per day, organized into themes.
Planned themes include:

1. Perception and Automation in surgical robotics
2. Novel surgical instruments for surgical robots
3. Other topics as submitted including but not limited to
  - Teleoperation
  - Human-Robot Interactions in surgery
  - Computational, sensing, and robotic approaches to surgical skill assessment
  - Others?

## Call for Contributions

Please submit a 1/2 page abstract by 15-Jan-2021 via this [google form](https://forms.gle/EG5Zwpn5un7r4CAeA).
The form also includes a poll for possible symposium dates in late February or early March.

Contributions will be abstract-reviewed by the organizers. Decisions and program will be announced by 29-Jan-2021.

We encourage speakers to link their talks to an online document via public sites such as arXiv.

## Organizers

Organized by the Collaborative Robotics Toolkit Project (Johns Hopkins, WPI, Univ. of Washington).
