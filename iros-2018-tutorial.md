# IROS 2018 Tutorial on Collaborative Robotics Toolkit (CRTK) and Open Platforms for Medical Robotics Research

## Objectives
The objectives are to provide an in-depth tutorial on recent advances in open platforms for medical robotics research. This originated with two widely used open platforms, the Raven II robot and da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK), which are installed at more than 40 institutions worldwide, but has broadened to include other robots and devices, including simulated robots. The tutorial will first present the Collaborative Robotics Toolkit (CRTK), which defines a common API to the Raven, dVRK and other systems (https://github.com/collaborative-robotics).  It will cover the concepts and design of CRTK, followed by its ROS implementation.  The integration of CRTK with popular simulation/visualization platforms, including rviz, Gazebo, and Matlab, will be covered in depth and attendees will have an opportunity for hands on experimentation, using haptic input devices to teleoperate simulated robots and remote Raven II and dVRK robots.

The tutorial will include a _Community Tips_ session, consisting of presentations from researchers who have developed hardware and software extensions to these platforms that could be of interest to the community. For example, several groups have created custom instruments for the Raven II and dVRK and others have integrated various ROS packages with the systems. This session will provide a forum for community dissemination of this collective knowledge.

The tutorial will also include a _Contribution Guide_ session, which will explain best practices of software configuration management, including git workflows, and information about how to contribute to the evolving software infrastructure. In addition, the tutorial will cover the architecture and low-level programming environment of the Raven II and dVRK robots.  This would be of interest to researchers who wish to modify the low-level control of these platforms, rather than relying on higher-level interfaces via CRTK and ROS.
